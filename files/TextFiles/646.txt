This WikiProject is dedicated to improving the reliability of Wikipedia articles. We ensure that articles are supported by reliable sources, answer inquiries on the reliable sources noticeboard, and maintain a list of frequently discussed sources. This project works to achieve the goals of the verifiability and no original research policies. If you would like to help, please join the project, participate on the talk page and see the open tasks below. Getting started Do you have an article/fact/reference that needs checking? See the guidelines for help with tagging articles for review and correction. Do you need help creating citations? See the Referencing for beginners and Citing sources pages for information on how to write references and create citations Do you want to help improve the reliability of Wikipedia? Lend a hand with some of the open tasks, and add your name to the participants list. Do you have a question? Please feel free to comment on the project talk page, and someone will try to help as soon as possible! Give me something simple to do! There are over 415,661 "Citation needed" statements on Wikipedia. Click here to use the Citation Hunt tool which makes it easy to pick one to fix. Scope and goals Scope This WikiProject covers all articles on Wikipedia. Goals Ensure that content in articles is verifiable Identify and tag claims that require verification with appropriate templates Perform fact and reference checks for articles with verification templates Provide assistance with factual verification to editors Improve the reliability of sources cited in articles Add citations to reliable sources Replace citations to questionable sources with citations to better sources Remove content supported by questionable sources when it is unsupported by reliable sources Participate in discussions on the reliable sources noticeboard Affirm sources that have a reputation for accuracy, fact-checking, and error-correction Challenge questionable sources, including self-published sources authored by non-experts, sponsored content, and spam Maintain the list of perennial sources Add perennial sources that are missing from the page Index new discussions from the reliable sources noticeboard Update entries when noticeboard discussions are archived Guidelines Articles with no references For an article with no citations, add the template {{unreferenced}} to the beginning of the article to flag it for review and addition of citations. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles lacking sources. Articles based on a single source If the article has only one reference or external link (that is related to the article content), use {{one source}} to put the article in Category:Articles lacking sources. Articles with partial or incomplete sources For an article with partial sources, add the templates {{refimprove}} or {{primary sources}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles needing additional references or Category:Articles lacking reliable references. Articles with questionable resources For an article with questionable resources, add the templates {{verify source}} or {{verify credibility}} to put the article in to Category:Wikipedia articles needing factual verification. Articles with statements that lack references For an article with small numbers of statements lacking references, add the template {{citation needed}} or {{citations missing}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles with unsourced statements. Other maintenance templates are available at Category:Citation and verifiability maintenance templates. Open tasks How can I help now? There are a number of different Wikipedia Backlog categories that help track the existing backlog of referencing activities. They fall into two major groups, Lacking References and Ensuring Accuracy through existing references: Lacking references Needs references: 172,447 Needs references (BLP): 1,714 Needs more references: 390,700 Needs more references (BLP): 35,498 Needs in-text citations: 98,910 Needs reliable references: 76,057 Has unsourced quotes: 1,201 Has unsourced statements: 415,661 Fix one! Accuracy Uses broken or outdated citations: 81 Uses deprecated sources: 379 Needs factual verification: 8,149 Needs references list: 86 Needs references clean up: 3,079 Accuracy disputes: 8,415 Neutrality disputed: 6,217 Needs updating: 27,531 Has original research: 16,335 Self-contradictory: 579 Help now: Solve Citations Needed! At the moment, there are over 415,661 articles with "Citation needed" statements. They are some of the easiest referencing issues to solve, because you are frequently looking for a targeted and singular reference. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements. With 415,661 statements that need WP:Verification, sometimes it's hard to choose which article to work on. The tool Citation Hunt makes that easier by suggesting random articles, which you can sort by topical category membership. I can help! Give me a random citation to find!
